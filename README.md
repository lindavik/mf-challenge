## Setup

### Backend

This project uses Poetry which is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. 
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.
You can read more about Poetry, how to install it and set it up [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
